    "\n",
    "$$H = -J \\sum_{i} \\sigma_i \\sigma_{i+1} - h \\sum_i \\sigma_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma_i \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The partition function is:\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.2 The Transfer Matrix Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that we can write the partition function as a **matrix product**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z = \\sum_{\\sigma_1, \\ldots, \\sigma_N} T_{\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2} T_{\\sigma_2 \\sigma_3} \\cdots T_{\\sigma_{N-1} \\sigma_N} T_{\\sigma_N \\sigma_1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the transfer matrix $T$ is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T = \\begin{pmatrix} e^{\\beta J + \\beta h} & e^{-\\beta J} \\\\ e^{-\\beta J} & e^{\\beta J - \\beta h} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",

    "3. Correlations: Can be computed from eigenvectors\n",
